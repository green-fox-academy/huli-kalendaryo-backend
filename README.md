# Huli Kalendaryo Backend

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to provide a simple application where the user can collect event data from multiple calendars into one calendar that can be shared with the right people.

** This is the project's backend part, [here](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/huli-kalendaryo-android) you can find the link to its android repository.**

## Setting up the environment
To run the application's backend part you need to have the following things set up:

1. Create a a database schema with the help of MySQL

2. Ask us for the `debug.keystore` file (temporary solution during development), which you need to put in your Users/"yourusername"/.android folder (in case of windows)

3. Set the Active Profile to "dev" in your IDE (in IntelliJ Run/Edit Configurations)

4. Create the `application-dev.properties` file based on the contents of the provided `application.properties.example` file

5. You should set up the following environmental variables:
* CLIENT\_ID: this is created in the Google API Console to validate the application (ask us for the exact CLIENT_ID for the time being)
 * CLIENT\_SECRET: this is created in the Google API Console to validate the application (ask us for the exact CLIENT_SECRET for the time being)
* RDS\_HOSTNAME: your hostname in MySQL
* RDS\_PORT your port in MySQL
